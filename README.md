# Flipper Plugin Xstate

This plugin allows you to display an [XState Inspector](https://statecharts.io/inspect) as a tab in flipper. 

You must also use the [react-native-flipper-xstate](https://github.com/cpetzel/react-native-flipper-xstate) package for this to function.

# Usage

Until [this issue](https://github.com/algolia/npm-search/issues/726) is resolved, you must install the plugin manually by downloading the [tar.gz file directly from npm](https://registry.npmjs.org/flipper-plugin-xstate/-/flipper-plugin-xstate-1.0.4.tgz) and install from file.
